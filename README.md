# Hubble.gl

Hubble.gl is a JavaScript library for animating data visualizations.

- **High Quality Video:** Ensured framerates, high resolutions, and a variety of formats. Fine tune animations with keyframe markers and easings.

- **Easy Integration:** Stand up scenes within deck.gl or kepler.gl, then animate any aspect of it. Empower users to animate without code with UI components powered by this library.

- **Client Side Library:** Render within the browser without a backend. User data never leaves their machine. Since nothing runs on a server, sites can scale without backend encoders.
